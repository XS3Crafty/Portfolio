# Portfolio

My portfolio, that probably led you here, was heavily inspired by the work of another front end developer/designer Helena Zhang. Her beautiful portfolio can be found here: https://www.helenazhang.com/. I think homage might actually be a more fitting word. I tried my best to emulate many of my favourite details of her site within my own. Aspects such as the current section, cartoon avatar and the overall newspaper akin aesthetic were all carefully recreated. It began as a challenge for myself to build a minimalistic yet visually pleasing website that demonstrated the full range of my abilities. Whilst looking for inspiration I happened to come accross Helena's page and before I knew it i was designing one of my own. One of my many portfolios to come. If you havent viewed it already please be sure to check it out.
